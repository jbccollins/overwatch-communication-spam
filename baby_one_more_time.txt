And give me a sign
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Boy you got me blinded
Don't you know I still believe
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
It's not the way I planned it
My loneliness is killing me (and I)
Oh baby, baby how was I supposed to know
Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
Oh baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go
Show me how want it to be
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now, oh because
That something wasn't right here
That you will be here
The reason I breathe is you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
