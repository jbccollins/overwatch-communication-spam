Break it off, break it down
Bring it on, ring the alarm
Don't stop now, just be the champion
Go call the police, go call the governor
Here comes the big beat, big beat disaster
Here comes the smasher, here comes the master
Hold your head high, fingers to the sky
I am the bad bitch, the bitch that you'll never know
I bring the treble, don't mean to trouble ya'
I make the governor, call me the governor
Keep it building higher, and higher
Keep it moving higher and higher and higher
Look hot in a bikini? You better work bitch
No time to quit now, just time to get it now
Now get to work bitch!
Now they don't believe ya', but they gonna meet ya'
Party in France?
Pick up what I'm putting down
See me come and you can hear my sound
So hold your head high, fingers to the sky
Spread the word, spread the word
Tell somebody in your town
They gonna try to try ya', but they can't deny ya'
Watch out now, cause here it comes
Work it hard, like it's your profession
Work it out, work it out
Work, work, work, work
You better work bitch
You wanna live fancy? 
Live in a big mansion?
You want a hot body? 
You want a Bugatti?
You want a Lamborghini? 
Sippin' martinis?
You want a Maserati?
