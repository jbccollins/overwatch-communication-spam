'Cause you’re the flame I can’t do without
(Yeah, Eazy)
All the way and I’m able
And make me ooh (move), ooh, ooh (yeah), ooh
Baby, 'cause you’re the spark that won’t go out
Back and forth like this was all tennis
Blowing up to the ceiling, we’re burning bright
But I need you and I can take you
But we could tell that there’s changes coming
By the way I see you starin’ ‘cross the room, babe
Can tell you want me
Friday, I’m dreaming a mile a minute ’bout somebody
From the bar to the car, let’s take it back to my room
I don’t care if it’s a random person or the biggest star
I just want you to make me move
Igniting the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
I’m all jealous, you came with someone
I’ve always wondered what was off limits
Just cut the shit, be honest
Just want you to raise my roof
Like it ain’t a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Like Penelope in Blow
Listen, here we are, need you
Make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My heart’s on fire when you’re around
No rules
No shame in the game
Now follow me, let’s go
Out in Vegas or little bars
Really not a difference if it’s near or far
Said I need you and I can take you
See I could tell that you’re a dangerous woman
So follow me and I can make you
Something sensational (sensational, oh yeah)
Something sensational seansational, oh yeah)
Staring at you til I’m caught in this
That means you’re speaking my language, come on
That’s why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah
The fire comes in the sapphire sun
There’s no way I’m gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight
This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there’s no way
To give you something sensational, so let’s go, yeah
Well worth the stealing you, it’s a felony, yeah I know
We’re hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
When we cross the line
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight
Yeah, you make me ooh
