All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Better be ready, hope ya feel the same
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
I call the shots
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
I make it hot
I run a tight ship so, beware
I'm like a firecracker
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
I'm like the ringleader
I'm runnin' this (like, like, like, like a circus)
Just like a circus
Let me see what you can do
Like a what? (like, like, like, like a circus)
Ones that can hang with me, and ones that are scared
Show me what you can do
So baby I hope that you came prepared
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
There's only two types of guys out there,
There's only two types of people in the world
Well baby I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
When I crack that whip, everybody goin' trip
When I put on a show
