(You want a piece of me)
And end up settlin' in court
And with a kid on my arm
And you want a piece of me
Another day another drama
Are you kidding me?
Don't matter if I step on the scene
Guess I can't see no harm
Hopin' I'll resort to startin' havoc
I mean please
I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
I'm Miss American Dream since I was seventeen
I'm Miss bad media karma
I'm Mrs. 'Most likely to get on TV for strippin' on the streets'
I'm Mrs. 'You want a piece of me?'
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! this just in
I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous
I'm Mrs. Oh my God that Britney's shameless!
I'm Mrs. she's too big now she's too thin
I'm still an exception
In working and being a mama
No wonder there's panic in the industry
Now are you sure you want a piece of me?
Oh yeah
Or sneak away to the Philippines
They still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazine
Tryin' and pissin' me off
Well get in line with the paparazzi
When getting the groceries, no, for real
Who's flippin' me off
You want a piece of me?
