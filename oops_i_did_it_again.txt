"All aboard"
"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have."
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end."
"Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this..?"
"Oh, you shouldn't have."
"Well, baby, I went down and got it for you."
"Yeah, yes it is."
'Cause to lose all my senses
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
But to lose all my senses
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
Got lost in this game, oh, baby
I cry watching the days
I made you believe we're more than just friends
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
I think I did it again
I'm dreaming away
I'm not that innocent
It might seem like a crush
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!... I did it again
Oops!... I did it again to your heart
Oops!... You think I'm in love
Oops!... You think that I'm sent from above
That I'm sent from above
That is just so typically me
Wishing that heroes—they truly exist
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You see my problem is this
