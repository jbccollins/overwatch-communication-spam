'Cause we don't
(Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer)
All the other chicks out here
And maybe I could be your girl
Boy don't try to front, uh, I
But I call 'em like I see 'em
But I know what you are
But no way I'm ever gonna
Daddy-O
Fakin' like a good one
Gettin' more than just a re-up
Got a clue, what you doing?
Got all the puppets with their strings up
I got you crazy
I guess when you have one too many

Lollipop

You just can't find the right companion
You say I'm crazy
You're a womanizer, baby
You're nothing but a womanizer
You're oh so charming
